But for the sake of its longness, I chose a nickname for myself which is SMAKSS or a simpler version that I like the most is Max. I assume my self a software engineer, I assumed it because I know nothing about it. Before I assumed myself a software engineer I used to play video games a lot, so I was kind of gamer 🎮. I learnt about PC, games, and other stuff since I was a lil kid (2-3 years old). Then nothing in the world was more desirable than games for me. I did not enjoy school at all, even the university years were more awful. I studied computer science at the university, I didn\'t have a clue about it and what is it at all, but with all of these disasters, I managed to start programming and since the second year of the undergraduate study (2013) I start working. In those days I just knew how to copy-paste previous codes that I have to create a new thing 😁😁. It may seem weird in the first place but honestly, it worked almost all the time. Later on, I managed to work with some utility software like Photoshop and Illustrator, and you may not believe that but I just work with them like how I code 😂. With all the applicable skills (Who cares about them 😎) I manage to work with some startups and even start my own one with a bunch of comrades (I\'m not a communist myself but I found Marx and some of the idea behind it reasonable). In all of those years, I struggle a lot and tried to make a better version of myself and finally, I could take an internship in Microsoft as a Software Engineer, it was about three though months of my life, but I learnt a lot in those months more than all the previous years. After that, I applied for some opportunities in that company and could pass the initial test in some of them but since I always loved gaming stuff I rather worked with ATG (Advanced Technology Group) team. I always enjoyed being into new things and experience some new stuff, so I decide to get into web developing area, I worked with WordPress before but I knew nothing about the whole thing. Like before I start educating myself with online courses, I really wanted to get into this area so I tried to apply some application in the Microsoft itself but it turns out I knew nothing about web developing at all, so I couldn\'t pass the initial test. Those days were too exhausting, after working with Microsoft for about one year I just resigned and quit my job (I was a kiddo and I missed those days a lot 😌). I was in the middle of nowhere but I decide to start working on something so I just joined some new startup in Iran and tried to learn how to develop a real web application, as I said I knew nothing about it but I start working on a health application as a Full-Stack web developer I call it Full-Stack because I worked with 3 different stacks, one in the Frontend, one in the Backend, and another in Serverside. I worked with those tools for about 8 months, I learnt a lot about web application but I didn\'t really love what I did there, all of those stuff sometimes made me uncomfortable and overwhelming so I resigned and quit my job once again. But this time I knew what I\'m going to do I just wanted to work with a single side of the application either Backend, Frontend or Server. So I applied for some other companies for each of the them separately. I do not know how to call it maybe fate or whatever, but I suddenly found myself within a cool-ish company as a Frontend Engineer, since then I obsessed with Frontend tools and I like to continue my journey in this area. And that is what it is."},"cookie":"I have to admit it, I\'m using cookie to provide a better user experience.","info":{"description":"First of all, thanks for paying me a visit.
