      "main": "Hi there, my full name is Seyed Mohammad Ali Kazemi Sheykh Shabani, which is too long but I like it. But for the sake of its longness, I chose a nickname for myself which is SMAKSS or a simpler version that I like the most is Max. I assume my self a software engineer, I assumed it because I know nothing about it. Before I assumed myself a software engineer I used to play video games a lot, so I was kind of gamer 🎮. I learnt about PC, games, and other stuff since I was a lil kid (2-3 years old). Then nothing in the world was more desirable than games for me. I did not enjoy school at all, even the university years were more awful. I studied computer science at the university, I didn't have a clue about it and what is it at all, but with all of these disasters, I managed to start programming and since the second year of the undergraduate study (2013) I start working. In those days I just knew how to copy-paste previous codes that I have to create a new thing 😁😁. It may seem weird in the first place but honestly, it worked almost all the time. Later on, I managed to work with some utility software like Photoshop and Illustrator, and you may not believe that but I just work with them like how I code 😂. With all the applicable skills (Who cares about them 😎) I manage to work with some startups and even start my own one with a bunch of comrades (I'm not a communist myself but I found Marx and some of the idea behind it reasonable). In all of those years, I struggle a lot and tried to make a better version of myself and finally, I could take an internship in Microsoft as a Software Engineer, it was about three though months of my life, but I learnt a lot in those months more than all the previous years. After that, I applied for some opportunities in that company and could pass the initial test in some of them but since I always loved gaming stuff I rather worked with ATG (Advanced Technology Group) team. I always enjoyed being into new things and experience some new stuff, so I decide to get into web developing area, I worked with WordPress before but I knew nothing about the whole thing. Like before I start educating myself with online courses, I really wanted to get into this area so I tried to apply some application in the Microsoft itself but it turns out I knew nothing about web developing at all, so I couldn't pass the initial test. Those days were too exhausting, after working with Microsoft for about one year I just resigned and quit my job (I was a kiddo and I missed those days a lot 😌). I was in the middle of nowhere but I decide to start working on something so I just joined some new startup in Iran and tried to learn how to develop a real web application, as I said I knew nothing about it but I start working on a health application as a Full-Stack web developer I call it Full-Stack because I worked with 3 different stacks, one in the Frontend, one in the Backend, and another in Serverside. I worked with those tools for about 8 months, I learnt a lot about web application but I didn't really love what I did there, all of those stuff sometimes made me uncomfortable and overwhelming so I resigned and quit my job once again. But this time I knew what I'm going to do I just wanted to work with a single side of the application either Backend, Frontend or Server. So I applied for some other companies for each of the them separately. I do not know how to call it maybe fate or whatever, but I suddenly found myself within a cool-ish company as a Frontend Engineer, since then I obsessed with Frontend tools and I like to continue my journey in this area. And that is what it is."

Well, unlike people common opinion, designing and implementing a website is hard, but doing all this on your own and producing a cool result is damn hard. I'm not saying this is very cool (Who cares maybe it is!) but I tried my best on it. I built this all mostly for sharing my insights, also a showcase, and sharing new ideas. The whole source code of it (Its got many bugs right now 😁), is available on my GitHub page, so if you enjoyed it, you can fork it and create your own exclusive one, then you can buy me a coffee in return (Link is available in the very bottom of each page).",

I pride myself on my proficiency with multiple technologies, including jQuery, SCSS, React, Remix, Svelte, NPM Modules, D3.js, and Polaris. One of my proudest achievements was transitioning a legacy jQuery e-commerce platform to a cutting-edge React.js framework, resulting in marked performance and user experience improvements. I've also pioneered efficient architectural approaches for internal modules using Shopify CLI and have taken the initiative to publish standalone NPM modules to enhance compatibility with other Shopify add-ons. Always looking to innovate, I introduced a more efficient UX testing process for marketing platforms by integrating Cypress. Furthermore, I've built robust CI/CD pipelines for front-end applications to ensure smooth and dependable code deployment, leveraging tools like danger.js and PostCSS.",
